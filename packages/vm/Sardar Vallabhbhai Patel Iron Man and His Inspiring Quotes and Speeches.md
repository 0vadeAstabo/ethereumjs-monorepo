After India gained independence in 1947, Patel became the first Deputy Prime Minister and Home Minister of India. He was also in charge of the Ministry of States, which was responsible for integrating the 565 princely states into the Indian Union. He used diplomacy, persuasion and force when necessary to achieve this monumental task. He also oversaw the creation of the Indian Administrative Service and the Indian Police Service, which are the backbone of India's bureaucracy and law enforcement.
 
Patel died on December 15, 1950 in Bombay (now Mumbai) due to a heart attack. He was posthumously awarded the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian honour, in 1991. His legacy is honoured by various monuments, institutions and awards named after him. The Statue of Unity, which is the world's tallest statue, depicts Patel standing on the banks of the Narmada river in Gujarat.
